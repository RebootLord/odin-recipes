# odin-recipes

ASSIGNMENT:

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it.

(You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)  


Damn, thats lowkey hard. But I am trying to put into practice what I have learned with the first few lessons from The Odin Project and setup a basic website online

Wish me luck!
